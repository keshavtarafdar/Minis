    This is a bit hard to explain but basically, since the grid is being
    displayed as a grid - 9 columns - each row is being passed separately
    and so we want these divs to be "passed up" without any formatting
    straight to the grid above.
  
    display: contents effectively makes the <div class-'row'> invisible to
    the grid layout, treating the Cell objects within as direct children
    of the grid.
